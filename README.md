ABSTRACT
~ Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses. Originally a paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.	
~The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes representing each letter or number of the word. Rules may permit or forbid proper nouns, such as names, places, brands, or slang. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player adds (or alternatively, removes) one element of a hanged stick figure as a tally mark. Generally, the game ends once the word is guessed, or if the stick figure is complete — signifying that all guesses have been used.
~The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram. If the guesser makes enough incorrect guesses to allow the other player to complete the diagram, the guesser loses. However, the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters that appear in the word, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed.

IMPLEMENTATION :
<1>The Hangman program randomly select a scrert word from a list of secret words.The random Module will provide this ability ,so line 1 program imports it.
<2>The Game : Here,a random word(a fruit name)is picked up from our collection and the player gets limited chances to win the game.
<3>When a letter is that word is guessed correctly.that letter position in the word is made visible.In this way,all letters of the word are to be guessed correctly before the chance are over
<4>For convience,we have given length of word +2 chances.For example,word to be guessed is mango,then user gets 5+2=7 chances,a mango is a five-letter word.

This is a simple Hangman game using Python programming language. Beginners can use this as a small project to boost their programming skills and understanding logic.

OBJECTIVES:
	The objective of Hangman is to guess the word, letter by letter, posed by the questioner before the complete picture of the hanging man is drawn. The rules of Hangman are simple. If more than one person is guessing the letters, each one must take a turn to call out the chosen letter. This is a good exercise for teaching children to have patience.
